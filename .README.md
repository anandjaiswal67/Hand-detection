# Virtual Keyboard & Hand Gesture Mouse

This project provides two Python scripts for controlling your computer using hand gestures via your webcam:

- **[virtual_keyboard.py](virtual_keyboard.py)**: Displays a virtual keyboard on the screen. You can interact with the keyboard using hand gestures detected by your webcam.
- **[hand_detector_mouse.py](hand_detector_mouse.py)**: Turns your hand into a virtual mouse, allowing you to move the cursor, click, and scroll using hand gestures.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- [cvzone](https://github.com/cvzone/cvzone) (for virtual keyboard)
- [mediapipe](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/) (for hand detection)
- [pyautogui](https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (for mouse control)

Install dependencies with:

```sh
pip install opencv-python mediapipe pyautogui cvzone
```

## Usage

### Virtual Keyboard

Run:

```sh
python virtual_keyboard.py
```

- A virtual keyboard will appear.
